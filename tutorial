# CIS115 Tutorial
# Ch3: Decision Structures and Boolean Logic



# ------- Problem #1: if statement -------
# Step 1: Ask the user to input whether it is cold outside or not (Yes or No)
weather = str(input('is it cold or hot outside?\n'))

# Step 2: If it is cold, output "Wear a coat". Otherwise, do nothing.
if weather =='cold':
    print('Please wear a coat as its cold')


# ------- Problem #2a: Relational Operators -------
x = 1
y = 5
z = 2

# print(x > y)
# print(z <= y)


# ------- Problem #2b
# Ask the user to input their grades for the Ch1 and Ch2 quizzes
# and output the quiz with the highest grade
ch1 = int(input('Please input the grade of your ch1 quiz\n'))
ch2 = int(input('Please input the grade of your ch2 quiz\n'))
if ch1<ch2:
    print(ch2)
else:
    print(ch1)






# ------- Problem #3a: Equality/Inequality Operators -------
a = 2
b = 4
c = 4

# print(a == b)
# print(b == c)
# print(a != b)
# print(a != c)


# ------- Problem #3b
# Ask the user to input their password.
# If their password is correct, output "Successful login". 

password='bananasundae'
user = input('please enter your password\n')
if user==password:
    print('successful login')






# ------- Problem #4: if-else statement -------
# Step 1: Input a user's age (hint: convert to an integer)
age = int(input('Please input your age\n'))



# Step 2: If user is less than 18, output "Not eligible to vote."
# Otherwise, output "Voter!"
if age >=18:
    print('Voter!')
else:
    print('Not elgible to vote')




# ------- Problem #5: string comparisons -------
# Step 1: Input a word.
# Step #2: If the word is equal to "JACKPOT", output "You win!". Otherwise, output "You lose."
word = input('Please input a word')
if word in ['jackpot','Jackpot']:
    print('You Win!!')
else:
    print('You Lose!!')


# ------- Problem #6: Nested if-else statements -------
# Step 1: Input a person's age and input if they have a driver's license (Yes or No)
print('your age is',age)
id_ = input('do you have a drivers license?\n')



# Step 2: If person's age >= 16
if age >=16:
    if id_ in['yes','Yes']:
        print('elgible to drive')
    else:
            print('you are not able to drive')
elif age<16:
    print('too young')

    print('not elgible to drive')

    # Step 3: If person has a driver's license, output "Eligible to drive"


    # Step 4: Otherwise, output "No license"


# Step 5: Otherwise, output "Too young"
